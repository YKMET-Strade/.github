## What is YKMET: Strade

**YKMET: Strade** This is a ‘get kidnapped and murdered’ simulator with explicit sexual content. It is an entirely non consensual fantasy where the player is the victim and the perpetrator is a man. In this choose-your-own-adventure, every choice matters. Strade will get to know you and your personality through your actions, and it may affect your outcome. There are 21 endings, but even a single ending may play out a bit differently depending on your choices. You will die, of course. But dying isn’t the end- earn death tokens to unlock hints, walkthroughs, or bonus content. Maybe you’ll even find a way to survive. Your captor and central antagonist is Strade. He’s obsessive, curious, and evil. If you get to know him as well as he’ll get to know you, you might find a way out. Or maybe you’ll prefer to stay? I’m not judging anyone here.

This game contains optional sexual content. Explicit art and writing can be toggled at the beginning of a new game. Choosing to turn off sexual content DOES NOT make the game appropriate for minors, it is still a sexually themed game regardless and is always 18+. Warnings typically refer to actions happening to the player in first person. This is a ‘get kidnapped and murdered’ simulator with explicit sexual content. It is an entirely non consensual fantasy where the player is the victim and the perpetrator is a man. I cannot stress this enough. Please be aware of the warnings. NOT FOR MINORS. 18+ ONLY.
